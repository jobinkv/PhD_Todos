## Indroduction

This file is to monitor and guide my PhD work at IIIT Hyderabad
In my PhD I am mainly focusing three problems they are:

## Current work in progress

- [x] Write code for deep feature based segmentation and put it for running.(19/Jan). Insprided from [link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.6836v1.pdf)
      - [X] Checked the results and find all image are segment as a background! :(
      - [ ] Do the parameter tweaking
            ** [x] Rerun the code with 50 patch size and 7 training image so that the number of sample is grater than the feature dimensuion 4096.**
            ** [ ] Check the above!**
- [ ] Get the result with other features like SIFT SURF HOG LBP 

## My on going experiments
- [ ] Run the [work](https://github.com/mcimpoi/deep-fbanks) deep-filter banks. 
- [ ] Run the [work](https://github.com/HyeonwooNoh/DeconvNet) at atom need to check.
- [ ] 
      - [x] Status (Because of the caffe instalation issue the process is in hold)

## Need to fix items
- [ ] Running multiple versions of opencv in PC

## Document image segmentation
