## Indroduction

This file is to monitor and guide my PhD work at IIIT Hyderabad
In my PhD I am mainly focusing three problems they are:

## Current work in progress

- [x] Write code for deep feature based segmentation and put it for running.(19/Jan).
- [ ] Get the result with other features like SIFT SURF HOG LBP 
- [ ] Run the [work](https://github.com/HyeonwooNoh/DeconvNet) at atom need to check.
